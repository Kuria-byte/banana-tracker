          "Plantains (Musa paradisiaca) are a type of banana with a starchier, less sweet fruit that is typically cooked before eating. They are a staple food in tropical regions around the world, particularly in Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of Latin America.",

Plantains are versatile and can be prepared at various stages of ripeness, from green (unripe) to yellow (ripe) to black (very ripe).",
